This directory contains files for the election88 examples from the Gelman and Hill book.

To get started, source BUGSsetup.R.

In some cases, the system for running MCMCs includes running replicate runs of each case.  This works by writing the file setNimReplicate.R, which is then sourced by a new R process.

I am passing along mostly the setup, not all the cases I've run.  I'm including some nimble and also the Stan setup.
