### Background

\  

##### Application of Block Sampler

The JAGS block sampler (Metropolis-Hastings with multivariate normal proposal) is assigned to sample all multivariate distributions which are not otherwise conjugate.  JAGS contains conjugate samplers for multivariate cases:

- Multivariate Normal - Multivariate Normal (mean)
- Dirichlet - Multinomial (probability)
- Wishart - Multivariate Normal (precision)

\  

##### Source Code

The JAGS block sampler is called (in JAGS) the `MNormal` sampler, I assume for "Multivariate Normal".

Code implementing the JAGS block sampler can be found in the JAGS source code:

```
JAGS-4.2.0/src/modules/bugs/samplers/MNormal.cc
```

\  


##### General Outline of Adaptation Procedure

The JAGS block sampler has two distrinct "regimes".  When the mean acceptance rate reaches a desired range, it transitions from Regime 1 to Regime 2, never to transition back.

Regime 1: proposal covariance begins as the Identity matrix, and the diagonal elements uniformly scale.

Regime 2: both the scale factor and the elements of the covariance matrix will adapt.

\  


##### Fundamental differences from existing NIMBLE `RW_block` sampler

- The existance of two distinct regimes, and a one-time transition between them.
- Tracking the mean acceptance probability as *the mean of the actual acceptance probabilities*, instead of the observed fraction of accepted proposals (as NIMBLE does).
- Fixed target acceptance rate of 0.234 (NIMBLE has different, higher target rates, for dimension $d=2,3,4$).
- $scale$ is updated on *every iteration* in both regimes; proposal covariance is updated on *every iteration* in Regime 2 (NIMBLE only updates these every $adaptInterval=200$ iterations).
- Different algorithms for adapting $scale$ of proposal covariance (which also differs by regime), and for adapting proposal covariance (see below).


\  


### Regime 1 Details

\   

Initialize:

- $scale=1$
- proposal covariance: $\Sigma = I$
- $n_{step} = 10$ (governs adaptation of $scale$)

On each iteration:

- Propose MH transition: $x_{proposal} = x_{current} + scale \cdot W$, where $W \sim MVN(0, \Sigma)$
- If acceptance probability ($p$) *transitions relative to previous iteration* from below target acceptance rate (0.234) to above it, or vise-versa, then increment $n_{step} = n_{step}+1$
- Update: $scale_{new} = scale_{old} \cdot e^{\frac{p-0.234}{n_{step}}}$, thus decaying adaptation based upon value of $n_{step}$, bearing in mind the non-constant increment scheme of $n_{step}$.

Every 100 iterations:

- Calculate $\bar{p}$, the *mean acceptance probability over that last 100 iterations* (quite literally) as: $\bar{p} = \frac{1}{100} \sum_{\text{last 100 iterations}} p_i$
- If $0.15 \leq \bar{p} \leq 0.35$, then **transition to Regime 2**


\  

### Regime 2 Details

\  

Initialize:

- $n_{step} = 100$, regardless of where it ended in Regime 1 (somewhat equivalent, since we'll now be using $\sqrt{n_{step}}$)

On each iteration:

- Propose MH transition: $x_{proposal} = x_{current} + scale \cdot W$, where $W \sim MVN(0, \Sigma)$
- Increment $n_{step} = n_{step}+1$ (in Regime 2 increments on *every* iteration).
- Update: $scale_{new} = scale_{old} \cdot e^{\frac{p-0.234}{\sqrt{n_{step}}}}$ (note the root in exponent: slower decay, but continuously incrementing)
